I've been an Enterprise Architect for over 20 years. I unintentionally created the Enterprise Architecture Pitch Deck. My original idea was to catalogue the different reports you can make using the LeanIX Enterprise Architecture Suite . What questions do they answer? What data is needed to create them? What report settings and views are available? I was going to document this on a website. Then I thought of showing each report on a playing card to help me quickly prototype a slide deck and test the clarity of its message. I love playing games with friends and family. It was obvious \u2014 I needed to make a card game about Enterprise Architecture. Cards for work and play. Thanks to everyone who helped create the Enterprise Architecture Pitch Deck. Special thanks to those who influenced the game design: Susan Gates \u2014 for making up the numbers, despite not really wanting to play Calum Gates \u2014 for introducing me to new games and patiently explaining the rules Sophie Gates \u2014 for listening to my ideas and her diplomatic suggestions Charlotte Gates \u2014 for injecting her fun personality into the few game graced by her presence 000","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"The Enterprise Architecture Pitch Deck is a set of cards Enterprise Architects can use for work or play.
