# Rule variations


This is a simple variant on the standard game. It’s quick, flexible, adds pressure, and everyone gets to pitch. Even better, everyone can win.

1. Agree a Challenge card kudos value. 
	- This will determine the difficulty and length of the game. 
	- A small kudos value results in a quick game.
2. Each player chooses a Challenge card of the agreed value. 
3. Tell the challenge to the player on your left. 
	- Don’t show them the Challenge card as it shows one combination of Report cards needed to complete the challenge.
4. Use Report cards to create your pitch deck. 
	- You can agree take it in turns to pick up cards, or just go for it! 
5. When everyone has finished (or time is up), take it in turns to make your pitch.
	- Arrange the Report cards in the order you want to present them.
	- Talk to each Report card, explain the situation, the challenge and make your call to action. 
6. Other players agree if your pitch worked. 
	- If it did, you’re a winner.
	- If it didn’t talk through what was missing. 
7. Multiple players can win.

## Variations

Use any or all of these variations to change the game:

3.  Add the New Custom Report cards into the Report card deck to allow innovative pitches
4.  First player finish to pitch successfully wins
