## Design your pitch 

Arrange the **Enterprise Architecture Pitch Deck** cards to design and test your perfect pitch.

A common format for a presentation is: 

- Situation :fontawesome-solid-map-marker-alt:
- Challenge :fontawesome-solid-exclamation-triangle:
- Evidence-based analysis :fontawesome-solid-chart-bar:
- Recommendation :fontawesome-regular-lightbulb:
- Call to Action :fontawesome-solid-bullhorn:

Choose and order the pitch deck cards to prototype your pitch. 


:fontawesome-solid-map-marker-alt:{: .situation } > :fontawesome-solid-exclamation-triangle:{: .challenge } > :fontawesome-solid-chart-bar:{: .leanix } > :fontawesome-solid-chart-bar:{: .leanix } > :fontawesome-solid-chart-bar:{: .leanix }  > :fontawesome-solid-lightbulb:{: .recommendation } > :fontawesome-solid-bullhorn:{: .call-to-action } 


Situation > Work Challenge > Report > Report > Report > Recommendation > Call to Action


 
 
```
