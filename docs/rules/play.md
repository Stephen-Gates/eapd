# Play 

The **Enterprise Architecture Pitch Deck** game can be played by 2 to 4 players. Allow 45 minutes to play.

## Background 

You are an Enterprise Architect. Your organisation is facing many challenges. You’ve been asked to prepare a deck of slides to explain the situation and recommend actions to solve a challenge. These slides are your pitch deck. 

Other Enterprise Architects are also preparing pitch decks to solve challenges.

You want to earn kudos by solving challenges. If you’re quick, there’s an opportunity for one Enterprise Architect to present their pitch to the Executive and earn extra kudos. 

## Objective

**Get the most kudos by completing challenges**. 

Be careful, you'll lose kudos if you don’t complete a challenge.
