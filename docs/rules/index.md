# Enterprise Architecture Pitch Deck 

The **Enterprise Architecture Pitch Deck** is a set of cards Enterprise Architects can use for work or play. 

- **Work** - arrange the cards to design and test your perfect pitch
- **Play** - race to earn kudos and help the Executive solve challenges

## Work

**Use the Enterprise Architecture Pitch Deck to design and test your perfect pitch**.

As an Enterprise Architect, you often need to create a presentation that:

- :fontawesome-solid-map-marker-alt:{: .situation } sets the scene

- :fontawesome-solid-exclamation-triangle:{: .challenge } highlights a challenge 

- :fontawesome-solid-chart-bar:{: .leanix } analyses evidence 

- :fontawesome-solid-lightbulb:{: .recommendation } makes a recommendation 

- :fontawesome-solid-bullhorn:{: .call-to-action } issues a call to action


Read the [Work](work.md) card to get tips on designing the perfect pitch.

## Play

**Race to earn kudos by using your pitch deck to help the Executive solve challenges**.

Avoid unexpected events :fontawesome-solid-calendar-times:{: .event  } to be the only Enterprise Architect invited to present to the Executive :fontawesome-solid-users:{: .role }  

- Deliver a good pitch to become a trusted advisor and earn kudos :fontawesome-solid-star:{: .kudos } 
- Deliver an innovative pitch to gain extra kudos but only after you’ve faced the grilling :fontawesome-solid-fire-alt:{: .grilling }
- Be careful not to over-promise and under-deliver :fontawesome-solid-minus-circle:{ .over-promise }

Read the [Play](play.md) card to learn how to play the game.
