## Origin story

Hi, I’m [Stephen Gates](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdgates/) from Brisbane, Australia. I've been an Enterprise Architect for over 20 years. 

I unintentionally created the Enterprise Architecture Pitch Deck.

My original idea was to catalogue the different reports you can make using the [LeanIX Enterprise Architecture Suite](https://www.leanix.net/en/).

- What questions do they answer?
- What data is needed to create them?
- What report settings and views are available? 

I was going to document this on a website. Then I thought of showing each report on a playing card to help me quickly prototype a slide deck and test the clarity of its message. 

I love playing games with friends and family. It was obvious — I needed to make a card game about Enterprise Architecture. Cards for work and play. 

Thanks to everyone who helped create the Enterprise Architecture Pitch Deck. 

Special thanks to those who influenced the game design: 

- Susan Gates — for making up the numbers, despite not really wanting to play
- Calum Gates — for introducing me to new games and patiently explaining the rules
- Sophie Gates — for listening to my ideas and her diplomatic suggestions 
- Charlotte Gates — for injecting her fun personality into the few game graced by her presence 

~000~
