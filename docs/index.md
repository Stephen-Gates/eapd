 
# Enterprise Architecture Pitch Deck 

The **Enterprise Architecture Pitch Deck** is a set of cards Enterprise Architects can use for work or play. 

- **Work** - arrange the cards to design and test your perfect pitch
- **Play** - race to earn kudos and help the Executive solve challenges

An Enterprise Architect optimises an organisation's IT landscape by analysing its strategy, objectives, and performance. They make recommendations to solve challenges such as: 

- **application rationalisation** - lower costs by consolidating similiar applications
- **integration planning** - merge technology from two organisations
- **technology risk** - ensure business processes aren't put at risk by old technology

Every page in this website (except this one) represents a card in the Enterprise Architecture Pitch Deck.
